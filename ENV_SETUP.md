# Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend directory with the following variables:

```env
# Backend API URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Keep your existing Supabase configuration during migration
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## Instructions:
1. Copy the above content to a new file named `.env` in this directory
2. Add `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000` to your existing .env file
3. Keep all existing Supabase variables for now during the migration
